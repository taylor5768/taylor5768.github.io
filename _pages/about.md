I'm a PhD student in the <a href="https://linguistics.osu.edu"> linguistics department</a> at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">The Ohio State University.</a>  My research focuses on linguistic meaning, primarily using experimental and corpus-based methods.  In particular, I'm interested in the interface between different types of linguistic meaning: the literal meanings of words (semantics), meaning arising from context (pragmatics), and meaning that has to do with agents' social identities. Recently, I've been working on speaker commitment. I ask how do speakers express (un)certainty with respect to the claims that they make, and how this (un)certainty is interpreted.
